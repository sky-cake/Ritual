For example, let&#039;s suppose you wanted to design a suit of cosplay armor that will fit you, and you want to know what shapes to cut out of foam or cardboard that can be fitted together into your armor. You get a friend to wrap your whole body in saran wrap, then wrap around that saran wrap with duct tape. <br><br>Then you draw on the duct tape with a sharpy and try to partition the surface of into areas that have roughly zero gaussian curvature (either flat-ish surfaces like the front of your chest, cylindrical-ish sections like your upper arm, or conical sections like the taper of your forearm), areas with negative gaussian curvature (pringle\/saddle shapes, like where your pectoral muscle attaches to the arm), and areas with positive gaussian curvature (roughly spherical bumps like your shoulders or roughly spherical indents like your armpits). mark each region with a +, -, or 0 according to what its curvature is.<br><br>Once you separate the surface into these curvature areas mark each side of each label each side of each sharpie line with a number so you can put it all back together later.

They can just be cut out of foam as they are. + and - pieces will stubbornly not want to lie flat as they are. <br><br>The (+) pieces will get taught around the edges and loose in the middle when you try to flatten them. They may even tear around the edges if you try too hard. To get it to lie flat, you add some some labeled sharpie lines around the outside then cut them (like in your helmet photo). These are your darts. Do this until it lies flat.<br><br>The (-) pieces will get all wrinkly and fold over themselves around the edges if you try to flatten them. to get these flat, you gotta remove some material around the edges. Draw some pizza slices (godots) around the outside and label the edges, then cut the pizza slices all the way out, but hold onto them. Do this until each of the pieces lies more or less flat with no overlap around the edge of each main (-) piece. Now you have a bunch of flat pieces which you can trace onto your cardboard or whatever. Add a little extra size around all edges (except for the edges from darts and godots) so the thing isn&#039;t skin-tight. Cut all the pieces, bend them into shape, and glue them together by the edge labels.

I make pepakura for money. Models are usually constructed only once. My pieces are not so much like what we can find online; they tend to be VERY large and intricate, akin to a vg model. This is context for what my advice applies to. If you do it as an easy hobby or stick with truly low poly\/tiny part models, a lot won&#039;t apply. No pic related just inspo, this is advice dump not my art thread. If you have any questions, why X, tell me more about Z, I am happy to oblige. I rarely use 4chan and wrote this on a whim, sorry if no reply. If you are interested in reaching for the stars with pepakura, here are my personal trade secrets.<br><br>MATERIALS\/TOOLS<br>---Do not score the fold lines by hand. If you have a silhouette cameo, go ahead. To fold by hand purchase a glass scraper. I have two, one with a small 1.5 inch blade and another that is 4 inches. Dull the blade. I align the fold line across my fingers, press down with the blade.<br>---Stop using an xacto knife. Get a snap blade utility knife. I HIGHLY recommend OLFA, XA-1 design. <br>---Titebond II Premium wood glue. It doesn&#039;t cure instantly but that&#039;s good, you don&#039;t want that. You want to be able to move the tab around into the perfect position before it starts curing. You have a 10 second window to make sure it&#039;s in position before it starts curing, then another 10 seconds till you can let go &amp; any tension in the structure won&#039;t pull the tab out of place.<br>---Tiny squeezable craft bottles for glue. One of the bottles I added thicker medical syringe tube. It is long, which is good for when I have to apply glue to a tab which is difficult to access The other bottle has a 1 inch long coffee straw, I use that for when I need a lot of glue then spread it around. When a tab is huge I just open a jar of glue and use a brush to paint it on. <br>---Dental tools.<br>---Little neodymium magnets. I rarely use them, usually to hold a tab in place after the glue has already cured to the point that I can let go.

If you want a really nice product, move away from that. Texture has its use in hobby pieces.<br>The glue can overflow out of the seam and get on the paper. If you want to get rid of it then you&#039;ll have to cut that part off the model and start over. Look up fox pepakura. If I were to design a simple cute lil fox, that kind of coloring fits the model, but even so there is really no point in using colored paper. Just use painters tape to mask the area you want to paint, at that point you can now add subtle detail to your unique piece. <br>Aesthetically, the best part of large, complex pepakura is its geometry. A single light source makes the whole thing pop. Shadow brings it to life, moving the source changes its appearance. When I finish a piece I spray paint it white to remove imperfection. Most of my pieces sell in this state, that is just what most people want when I show them what it looks like with different light sources and light colors cast on it. I inform the buyer that I can paint it a different solid color, or I can give it a more intricate paint job with undershading\/zenithal highlight and\/or a more realistic design that doesn&#039;t take away from the geometry. <br>For example, a seahorse would do well with a base color, alternate coloring of specific geometry (using painters tape to mark off sections), eyes, and free form spray painting (letting the paint spit out in little drops, spraying highlight on tail tip, undershading), finalize with matte\/clear glaze. The geometry is retained and highlighted through this paint job. Don&#039;t overdo. My goal is not to make it appear realistic like VGs do to convince you it does&#039;t have geometry. I&#039;m not going to print texture on it, not going to use a paintbrush. If I wanted to make a giant realistic seahorse I wouldn&#039;t be using paper as a medium. Its form is inherently geometric. Any color design should compliment that.","filename":"4draguns","ext":".jpg","w":2880,"h":2160,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1699268613570745,"time":1699268613,"md5":"v2drLLpI77ydMcGQWrn\/lQ==","fsize":301741,"resto":624026},{"no":624030,"now":"11\/06\/23(Mon)06:10:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"GOING BIG<br>Working with such large paper models requires support. 3D printing at this scale has so much imperfection, time and risk of failure, it would be very heavy and require a complex web of internal support. As an art form, sculpting\/mold pouring also isn&#039;t under threat from this tech in my eyes. For my pieces, shoddy woodworking as a skeleton does the job and I pad the areas were wood contacts the paper with pool noodles, pillow filling wrapped in fabric, fire hazard stuff. 120 lb paper is flexible, surprisingly resilient, and the final product is so lightweight it&#039;s never going to warp if properly supported. I use wood glue so the paper will rip before the tabs will ever become unsecured.<br>I&#039;ve had to finish assembly after transport on site, that&#039;s something I avoid, logistic crap. I tend to base the size of my largest pieces around standard dimensions. Standard height of a ceiling, standard width and height of a door and double doors.

If you&#039;re making a cat and the proportions look weird just look at a reference and keep messing with it till it seems right. Once you have the proportions right you can make the polygons look more geometric-y. I am not a creative person.

I&#039;ll say that it is nice to be able to fold things that aren&#039;t cranes again. To keep things on topic, I keep a set of paper at work that I usually fold with when I&#039;m bored.

Cranes are very simple to fold, so you can really use whatever paper you find to fold them with. One ream of A4 can easily be cut down into 2000 squares if you want some easily accessible paper. There is also something special about origami made from found paper, so you could also get creative with were you get your sheets from if you&#039;re short on money. I guess what I&#039;m saying is don&#039;t let it get to you too much. I&#039;ve never liked the whole &quot;it&#039;s not about the destination&quot; outlook, but I&#039;d hate to see you quit the journey over this.

If anyone has a copy I would gladly pay for a scan with Paypal, thank you.","filename":"cover200","ext":".jpg","w":510,"h":720,"tn_w":177,"tn_h":250,"tim":1691096356538277,"time":1691096356,"md5":"szyNlSa2n2PHUSQJGw+b8Q==","fsize":65649,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tanteidan-magazine-200","replies":36,"images":3,"omitted_posts":31,"omitted_images":2,"last_replies":[{"no":625618,"now":"02\/23\/25(Sun)11:47:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p625615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;625615<\/a><br>this one?<br>https:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/file\/ijo1<wbr>fvurwgut4qi\/204.pdf\/file","time":1740329256,"resto":625586},{"no":625619,"now":"03\/04\/25(Tue)22:30:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"I wan that Poco Poco diagram from OTM 200, I want that and nothing else.","time":1741145459,"resto":625586},{"no":625620,"now":"03\/05\/25(Wed)17:37:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p625619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;625619<\/a><br>https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1bM<wbr>G02SF39k25oyeyKHfzMF_m76P7bqK8\/view<wbr>?usp=drive_link","time":1741214265,"resto":625586},{"no":625621,"now":"03\/06\/25(Thu)09:58:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p625619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;625619<\/a>","filename":"otm200","ext":".pdf","w":1,"h":1,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1741273118635461,"time":1741273118,"md5":"ZXwWQXNIbA9fzKXY0DMvYA==","fsize":8328131,"resto":625586},{"no":625622,"now":"03\/06\/25(Thu)21:50:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p625621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;625621<\/a> <a href=\"#p625620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;625620<\/a><br>Thank you very much for the help.","time":1741315807,"resto":625586}],"last_modified":1691096356}]},{"page":11,"threads":[{"no":622919,"now":"05\/17\/16(Tue)21:56:39","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Paper Pendulum Clock kit","com":"does anyone have Paper Pendulum Clock kit or pattern?
