# If only a blacklist is specified, skip blacklisted posts, and archive everything else.
# If only a whitelist is specified, archive whitelisted posts, and skip everything else.
# If no lists are specified, archive everything.

# If a thread is marked as "should archive" from the above rules, media downloads can be further filtered based on dl_thumbs, and db_full_media.
# To download all/no media, specify True/False. To filter media, assign a regex pattern.
